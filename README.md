# Women Empowerment Index

**Description:**

The Women Empowerment Index (WEI) dataset offers a comprehensive assessment of women's empowerment across countries and regions, encapsulating various dimensions including economic participation, political representation, access to education and healthcare, and social inclusivity. With key indicators such as the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI), Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI), and categorizations based on empowerment and parity groups, the dataset facilitates nuanced analysis and comparison of gender dynamics globally. Additionally, classifications into Human Development Groups and alignment with Sustainable Development Goal regions provide contextual insights into the development landscape. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the status of women's empowerment and identifying opportunities for progress and intervention on a global scale.
